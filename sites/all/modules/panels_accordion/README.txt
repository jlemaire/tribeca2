==============================================================================

This module adds an accordion style setting to Panels 2, more specifically
Mini Panels.

A JavaScript accordion hides all but the active area that a user clicked on.
When the user clicks the heading of an area it activates that area, the
rest will be hidden.

You need to be using Panels 2 and enable Mini Panels (for now).

  1. Go ahead and build your mini panel, fill it with 2 or more panes.

  2. Click on "Layout Settings"
  3. Choose "Accordion" from dropdown
  4. Click "Edit Style settings" and Select your "Action", "Effect", and "Speed"
  5. Save
  6. Build a Panel Page that contains your Mini Panel, style it with some CSS.

**NOTE**
Make sure your Content in the mini panels has a title.
You have the option to override that title when building the Panel Page
