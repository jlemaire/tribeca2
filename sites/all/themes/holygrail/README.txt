Holy Grail Theme

This theme requires Drupal 6 and PHPTemplate.

It is intended as a base theme for others to extend. It uses concepts from Matthew Levine's 2006 article "Holy Grail Layout", in this A List Apart: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/holygrail

Couple of Notes: 

1. It's highly recommended that you install the conditional style module (http://drupal.org/project/conditional_styles) with this theme, as the conditional stylesheets are necessary for IE7.

2. This theme is currently written in HTML5 and a .js for IE is included.

Drupal 6 theme designed and developed by Shaun Wolf Wortis (swortis).
